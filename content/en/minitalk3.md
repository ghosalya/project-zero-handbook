# Start of Alpha Stage

### _It's time to nail things down!_
- Collect your data
- Finalize, more or less, your core mechanics
- Move to main body production!

### _Alpha Stage!_
In this stage, there's no more prototyping! If you have decisions to make, try to make them now. Because after this is the heaviest part of coding!
