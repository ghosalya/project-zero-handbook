# First Playable Prototype

### _First._

![first](https://media.tenor.com/images/a8e424081798c21b01dfbd830e5d5e19/tenor.gif)

It's a _draft_ of your game. Your first! Continually update your design. Don't worry so much about quality. Get something, anything, so you can start playtesting it.

### _Playable._
You need to be able to playtest it, in some way. So include I/O and main gameplay mechanics. Buggy is fine! And no features is also ok...for now.

### _Prototype._
Is it fun? Is it feasible to build? What improvements can we do? What streamlining can we do?

### _So now we have an idea, let's start codi-HOW ABOUT ~~NO~~ YES!_
Digital prototyping! It's a _"prove yourself properly"_ phase.  
Check the technical feasibility of your core game mechanic. Something like "playing the game feels fun pt 2".

### _Nothing is set in stone yet!_
This FPP stage is your **last** chance to change any of the core concepts. Once alpha starts, most things are nailed down. Prepare (mentally) for a pivot!

### _Pivot?_
It's a process of drastically changing your "direction". Some elements of your idea may remain, but not much. Usually in response to playtesting or new info, you will do a pivot. 

In larger projects, number of pivots **do** correlates with success.
- Zer0: team culture too inflexible
- One - two: _just right_
- Three - âˆž: too indecisive!

So pivot **only** when you **need** to!
