# Time to Do Some Cutting (not the psycho kind)

Referring from last week . . . .
### _What you **CANNOT** leave until Beta Stage_
- Main gameplay mechanics
- **Basic** art assets
- Essential UI

### _Cut, cut, cut!_
_"Oh shit we can't make it"_ — Everyone ever.  
Time to trim your dreams before you get rekt.

### _Assess your features_
- Completed and good enough?
- Needs polishing or fixing?
- Not done??
- Not even started????

![what the heck have you been doing if you havent started yet](https://media1.tenor.com/images/4d3623a71cd2d31313f71c3b5e3c6dc5/tenor.gif?itemid=7453705 "what the heck have you been doing if you havent started yet")
###### (I hope you started already. Really.)

### _What will it look like next week?_
- Completed and good enough?
- Needs polishing or fixing?
- ~~Not done??~~
- ~~Not even started????~~

### _What you need to **finish** during beta_
- **ALL** mechanics
- **ALL** content extensions
- Most sound effects
- Most art and UI

### _Only leave for **GOLD**,_
- Final polishing on art & UI
- Playing _whack a mole_ with bugs.
- Making promotional materials
    - Trailer / screenshots
    - Poster / title art

### _For those who are really attached..._
If you can’t move on, just imagine this is graded and has a hard deadline. If you really like your game, you can expand on it **after the workshop**. But get it to a _‘finished’_ state first! It may never move on.

Now,
## _Git on with it._
