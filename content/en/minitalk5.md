# Polishing up and Preparing to Finish

Referring from last week . . . .
### _What you need to **finish** during beta_
- **ALL** mechanics
- **ALL** content extensions
- Most sound effects
- Most art and UI

### _For those who did not make it for previous weeks' targets_
- No polishing phase for you (EA Games, anyone?)
- Finish up what you can



### _Gold Phase Tasks_
- Final polishing on art, sound and UI
- Playing whack-a-mole with bugs
- Making promotional material
    - Trailer/screenshots
    - Poster/title art

### _For those who are really attached..._
If you can’t move on, just imagine this is graded and has a hard deadline. If you really like your game, you can expand on it **after the workshop**. But get it to a _‘finished’_ state first! It may never move on.
