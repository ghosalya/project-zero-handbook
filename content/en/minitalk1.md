# Importance of Concepting Deeply

### _Hold my beer._
This is a line for those who **REALLY** don't mind failing.
What it's really trying to say is **check before you jump off a cliff**. When you commit to projects like this, you are hinging all your time, effort and maybe money on whether your idea can eventually be refined into something good. So before you do anything, you should take the time to fully explore your idea and think about **alternatives**.

### _Why Concept Deeply At the Start?_
- Problems are easier to fix in advance than when you are neck-deep in a hole you dug yourself.
- Make your life easier by building foundation mechanics that supports the final image.
- Have a clear view of your goal and make sure the same goal is shared among the whole team.

### _All ideas are shit ideas*,_
*At first.

Don’t worry about people stealing your ideas. Ideas are cheap, it’s **execution** that is difficult. And part of execution is *refining* your idea properly.

### _Where does refinement comes from?_
- Discussing with **other** designers.
- Comparing and mixing with **other** ideas.
- Testing and feedback with **other** players.

A lof of **others**, isn't it?

Well, refinement does not occur in a vacuum. You may think you have the best idea in the world, but it really isn’t. Its flaws and possible improvements are just difficult for the original creator to see, so you have to discuss with others about it.

### _Mechanics, Dynamics, Aesthetics_
Mechanics are baseline rules/elements  
Dynamics are what player can do with the mechanics  
Aesthetics are the experience that players feel

An example,  
Mechanics - Player can light fires  
Dynamics - Player can light every object on fire  
Aesthetics - Player will feel like a pyromaniac uber God

But mechanics **are not** inherently good! You have to spend effort making them.  
Note that they complicate learning to play the game. They may enable good things, but may also detract from the experience instead, or be a hassle.

Aim for dynamics **or** aesthetics, mechanics only exist to bring out this 2!

Dynamics focused game: DOTA and co.  
Aesthetics focused game: Hellblade

### _So now we have an idea, let's start codi-HOW ABOUT NO?_
Let's start with **paper prototyping**.
Why?  
It's cheap, fast, check gameplay issues/benefits before expending any effort coding it.  
You may create the mechanics, but dynamics are created by players!  
Check your mechanics: is it fun?  Does it create good dynamics? Or is it just annoying?

An example of a paper prototype:

Have fun
